- ## About

Swift is a fast and efficient programming language designed to work seamlessly across Apple's ecosystem. Itâ€™s not only beginner-friendly, but also powerful enough for advanced programmers. This repository is my space to:

- Learn and practice Swift programming from basic to advanced topics.
- Document my progress and understanding of Swift concepts.
- Share Swift programming projects and exercises to reinforce learning.
  
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what you'll find in this repository:
- **Basic Swift**: Variables, control flow, functions, structs, and basic error handling.
- **Intermediate Swift**: Optionals, closures, protocols, extensions, generics.
- **Advanced Swift**: Memory management, concurrency, custom operators, and advanced error handling.
